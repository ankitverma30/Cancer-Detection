# Cancer-Detection
In today’s world detecting whether a person is suffering from cancer or not fully depends on the doctors. After seeing the reports doctors are finally able to say whether there is cancer or not. Breast Cancer is second most dangerous cancer after lung cancer.  If we are able to detect it in its early phases then it is very much easier to treat and cure it. There is more possibility to save life.

A tumor is abruptly development of cells. At the early phases when the cells in the tumor are regular, it is benign. When the cells turn out seriously and they create a lump, at this point these cells are surprising and can grow uncontrollably, they are cancerous cells and it becomes dangerous.
 
To determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant (say cancerous), a sample of the cell is analysed under a microscope by a pathologist and he determine with the help of his/her knowledge whether the given cell is of benign or malignant (cancerous cell).
Characteristics of Malignant (i.e. Cancerous Cell) Tumors: -
•	Cell can spread throughout the body
•	Cell grow rapidly
•	They can often spread into basal membrane that surrounds nearby healthy tissue
•	They Can spread into our different body parts via bloodstream or lymphatic system or by sending    fingers into nearby tissue
•	They can recur after removal, sometimes in areas other the original site which make its more dangerous.
•	Malignant Cells have abnormal chromosomes and DNA characterized by large, dark nuclei and may have abnormal shape.
•	They can secrete substances that cause fatigue and weight loss during their spreading.

A person detected with cancerous cell requires aggressive treatment, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy medications.

In previous era, the X-ray was the only method that was used to detect the breast cancer. However, in this era, many other methods have been generated and proposed for detecting process that are more   efficient than x-ray procedure such as, neural networks, artificial intelligence, and data mining.

Image processing techniques are used to convert the image from one to another format and for feature extraction of the images that helps to get a more useful data set.
The intuition underlying Nearest Neighbor classification is quite straightforward, examples are classified  
based on the class of their nearest neighbors. Generally, it is advantageous to take more than one neighbor, therefore the technique is commonly known as K- Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classification, where k Nearest Neighbors are used in determining the class.

The basic idea is as shown in Figure 1 which depicts a 3-Nearest Neighbor Classifier on a two-class 
problem in a two-dimensional feature space. In given example result for q1 is straightforward as all three nearest neighbors are of class O, so it is also classified as an class O. The result for q2 is bit difficult as its two neighbors are of class X and one of class O. It can be solved with the help of majority voting or distance-based voting (refer below).

So, KNN classification has two stages:

 1)The first is the determination of the nearest neighbors and the 
 2)second is the determination of the class using those neighbors.


It doesn't attempt to develop a general inside problem yet contrasts the new problem and instances seen in preparing which has been put away in memory. The reason for the k-closest classification is to utilize an information in which the information focuses are isolated into various classes to classify new data points dependent on similarity measures (for example distance function).Object classification is decided by number of majority votes of its neighbor. The object is assigned to the class which has the nearest neighbors.
